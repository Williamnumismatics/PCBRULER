## 10/27/2025 7 PM - Deleted most of my work :(  

I just relised i could put a normal rasberry pi pico 2w instead of making my own. Did waste some time but i am happy that i realised it cause it saved me a headache of soldering later down the line.![Screenshot_20251027_190341](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTkwMywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--1309ebfdd592523297aac84b05e344d6a6ff852c/Screenshot_20251027_190341.png)
  

## 10/27/2025 8 PM - Change of mind  

Accually, i changed to doing the custom PCB again its still kinda tricky but i think i can pull through rn i have just finished routing the flash storage or smthing.![Screenshot_20251027_203159](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTkwNiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--211fdfe29ba169844854c570637f36cb9fe357dc/Screenshot_20251027_203159.png)
